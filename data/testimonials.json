I used Medence's service â€” their lawyer found a legal issue that could have landed me in major trouble. Just that one review saved me from some financial disaster. Kudos to the team!",

    "testimonial": "My flatmate came across medence over his social media about their free rental agreement checker. We were already in trouble by then though. Our landlord without any warning or reason cut our deposit. And since we are young corporate guys we didn't want to further risk our careers by retaliating against landlord. But medence helped us recover our money from him legally without our involvement. Many other lawyers outside that we approached before meeting medence have inflated costs that were almost double of our 55k deposit. Medence gave us an easy way out here with their flexible plans. Made us feel it was fair. You guys are doing something that most startups fail which is impacting lives in a ways that actually matter.",

Please come to my hometown as well haha.",
